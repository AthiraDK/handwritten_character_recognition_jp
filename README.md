# About
This repository contains the implementation of a CNN- based recognition system for Japansese Handwritten Characters based on [this paper](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/262_Report.pdf).

Different models have been implemented using tensorflow-keras for the following tasks :
1. Script discrimination  between Katakana, Hiragana and Kanji scripts
2. Recognition of character within Hiragana dataset
3. Recognition of character within Hiragana dataset
4. Recognition of character within Hiragana dataset
5. Recognition of character from a combined dataset

# Data used :
The dataset from [ETL character database](http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/) is used.
Specifically,
- Kanji and Hiragana data were extracted from ETL-8G
- Katakana dataset was extracted from ETL-1
